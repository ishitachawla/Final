# GitHub Action for Validating Action Repositories
A GitHub Action to validate action repositories. There are certain validations that need to be checked in an Action repository. For instance, it is ideal for an Action repository to have a README file with an Example workflow and Contribution Guidelines.

With this Action, you can check for essential [Validations for an Action repository](https://github.com/Azure/actions/blob/main/docs/validations-action-repo.md). For every check, either a success message will be displayed or an error will be thrown.   

## Input
`GITHUB_TOKEN`: Personal access token of your repository. Uses your access token PAT_TOKEN.

## Output
All required validations will be run and a success message or an error will be shown in the console as output.

## Example
```yml
name: "build"

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Testing action
      uses: ishitachawla/action-repo-validation@releases/1
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_Token }}
```
